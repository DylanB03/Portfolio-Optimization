### Background definitions

Portfolio Optimization
- Maximize return while minimizing the risk (constrained)
- Selection of best asset mix 

Quantum Algorithms
- Algorithm that runs on models of quantum computers
- Step by step procedure to perform calculations, all performed by a computer

Second Order Cone Programs
- See ```second_order_cone_program.md```

Quantum Optimization
- Quantum computing and algorithms to solve optimizaation problems
- Common method is: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
    - QC explores solutions while classical computer optimizes parameters, a hybrid approach to QO
